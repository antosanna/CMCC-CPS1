Additional steps to run the operational chain:

-installation of miniconda for all the postprocessing packages (only envcondacm3 will rely on system anaconda -presently also envcondanemo)
-definition of load_miniconda to initialize miniconda where needed

conda environments needed

      envcondarclone=rclone_gdrive
      envcondaclm=postprc_CLM_C3S
      envcondacm3=cmcc-cm_py39
      envcondanemo=
      envcondachecker=
